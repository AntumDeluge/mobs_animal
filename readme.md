# ANIMAL MOBS

### Kitten
Found on green grass these cute cats walk around and can be picked up and placed in inventory as pets or right-clicked with 4x live rats or raw fish (found in ethereal) and tamed.  They can sometimes leave you little gifts of a hairball.

*Note: After breeding, animals need to rest for 4 minutes and baby animals take 4 minutes to grow up, also feeding them helps them grow quicker...*
