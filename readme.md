# ANIMAL MOBS

### Cow
Wanders around eating grass/wheat and can be right-clicked with empty bucket to get milk. Cows will defend themselves when hit and can be right-clicked with 8x wheat to tame and breed.

*Note: After breeding, animals need to rest for 4 minutes and baby animals take 4 minutes to grow up, also feeding them helps them grow quicker...*
